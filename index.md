# Professional Self-Assessment

My name is Nathaniel Ingle, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my journey as part of the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University. Through this program I have developed a deep understanding and appreciation for the fundamentals of computer science, including data structures, software engineering best practices, and security. Beyond these hard skills, I have also acquired a powerful repertoire of soft skills, such as teamwork and effective communication with diverse audiences. These skills will prove invaluable in any workplace setting.

In CS-250, Software Development Lifecycle, I worked with a team of other students to complete projects through an agile workflow, mimicking a common industry practice. This developed my skills as an effective communicator and collaborator. In CS-255, System Analysis and Design, I learned how to design software and professionally communicate with stakeholders in order to ensure that both technical and business needs were met.  In CS-300, DSA: Analysis and Design, I learned how to develop algorithms which met time and space complexity requirements and gained familiarity with data structures and algorithms commonly used in professional software. In CS-465, Full Stack Development I, I developed a full stack application that met business needs using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. In DAD-220, Intro to Structural Database Environments, I worked with relational databases and gained comprehensive knowledge of SQL. In CS-305, Software Security, I learned common security practices and how to identify vulnerable software.

These courses have helped to hone my skills in software development. They have also been powerfully complemented with a broad education in history, the humanities, social science, and natural science, providing me with an approach to work that is refined, ethical, and knowledgable. 

To demonstrate these skills, I have assembled this ePortfolio, which will serve as the capstone project for my computer science program. In it I have provided one artifact that I have improved in three key areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. The artifact is a weight-tracking app that I built the course CS-360, Mobile Architecture and Programming. The original program was built using Android Studio and Java and designed to run on mobile devices. I have redesigned it into a server-based webpage using Django and Python.
