# Professional Self-Assessment

My name is Nathaniel Ingle, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my journey as part of the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University with a focus on application creation. Through this program I have developed a deep understanding and appreciation for the fundamentals of computer science, including data structures, software engineering best practices, and security. Beyond these hard skills, I have also acquired a powerful repertoire of soft skills, such as teamwork and effective communication with diverse audiences. These skills will prove invaluable in any workplace setting.

In CS-250, Software Development Lifecycle, I worked with a team of other students to complete projects through an agile workflow, mimicking a common industry practice. This developed my skills as an effective communicator and collaborator. In CS-255, System Analysis and Design, I learned how to design software and professionally communicate with stakeholders in order to ensure that both technical and business needs were met.  In CS-300, DSA: Analysis and Design, I learned how to develop algorithms which met time and space complexity requirements and gained familiarity with data structures and algorithms commonly used in professional software. In CS-465, Full Stack Development I, I developed a full stack application that met business needs using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. In DAD-220, Intro to Structural Database Environments, I worked with relational databases and gained comprehensive knowledge of SQL. In CS-305, Software Security, I learned common security practices and how to identify vulnerable software.

These courses have helped to hone my skills in software development. They have also been powerfully complemented with a broad education in history, the humanities, social science, and natural science, providing me with an approach to work that is refined, ethical, and knowledgeable. In addition to the work I completed as part of my coursework, I have also worked on independent projects such as [a blog site written in Clojure](https://github.com/wyrxr/my-blog). Functional programming has been a personal passion for me since I was first introduced to programming, and I believe that it represents a new and positive direction for the software industry as a whole, as mainstream languages continue to adopt functional features and styles of coding. 

To demonstrate my skills, I have assembled this ePortfolio, which will serve as the capstone project for my computer science program. In it I have provided one artifact that I have improved in three key areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. The artifact is a weight-tracking app that I built the course CS-360, Mobile Architecture and Programming. The original program was built using Android Studio and Java and designed to run on mobile devices. I have redesigned it into a server-based webpage using Django and Python. 

# Code Review

As part of this process, I performed an informal code review to demonstrate the existing functionality of the application and point out any areas for improvement. This formed the basis for my future enhancements.

# Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

The [original artifact](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/tree/main/WeightTrackerAndroidApp) is a weight-tracking app I built as part of my Mobile Architecture and Design class in December of 2024. The purpose of the application is to allow individuals to track their weight over time. The user inputs their current weight and the application records the weight along with the current time. The user is presented with a chronological record of previous entries that allows them to review their weight changes over time.  

Despite the simplicity of this artifact, it demonstrates many of the core skills needed to be a successful developer, such as program development, database management, and user experience design. The original artifact is written in Java using Android Studio while the enhanced version is written in Python using the Django framework and PyCharm IDE. This demonstrates familiarity with multiple programming languages, ecosystems, and development tools. The primary improvement to the artifact lies in creating [a full server application](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/tree/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp) that can be delivered to any computer running a modern web browser, while the Android application could only run on devices compatible with the Android SDK. This added flexibility allows the application to reach more users than it would otherwise.  

The application was successfully ported to Python using the Django framework. I have improved the user experience and user interface, as well as added new functionality like independent user accounts that properly partition user weights.

The primary challenges I faced while developing this enhancement related to becoming familiar with the Django framework. This involved reading books and guides related to the framework to understand it and develop software that met the requirements. I have learned how Django uses [models](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/weighin/models.py#L13-L25) to facilitate database operations, how its Model-View-Template pattern compares to the Model-View-Controller pattern used by Java and Android, and how Django uses URL patterns to route specific URLs to Python functions and classes. I have continued to improve my understanding and implementation of CSS and frontend development techniques to create a visually appealing and accessible website.

# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

To demonstrate knowledge and capability in algorithms and data structures, I implemented a linear regression model that displays [a graph of the trend in user weights over time](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/weighin/views.py#L62-L103). Linear regression is a core algorithm in machine learning and data science, and understanding how it works on a mathematical level can help to conceptualize problems in a variety of domains. When tracking one’s weight, natural fluctuations make the data noisy, meaning it can be hard to discern the general trend. The trend line thus adds a necessary component that improves usability. 

For this enhancement I intended to demonstrate mastery of analyzing and designing algorithmic solutions to problems in a way that appropriately manages trade-offs. I have successfully accomplished this goal by demonstrating the ability to accurately implement a core algorithm, and I have chosen an implementation that best addresses performance concerns. I chose a closed form (analytical) solution, which means that for any dataset, the computational load increases linearly, rather than using an iterative (numerical) solution, which could have an arbitrary execution time. Based on the speed that the current algorithm can be calculated and the expected limited dataset (any one user shouldn’t exceed several thousand weigh ins), the closed form solution seemed most appropriate.  

![Weigh-in graph showing user's long-term progress](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/images/weight-graph.png?raw=true)

Implementing this algorithm allowed me to brush up on my statistical reasoning skills and my understanding of core mathematical subjects. It has also given me that chance to practice separation of concerns, as I added [a separate utils.py file](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/weighin/utils.py) to contain the algorithm which can contain new features when they need to be added. Since the framework I had previously created provided a strong base for building new modules and pages, creating a new page and hooking up the needed paths required minimal effort, exemplifying the benefit of modular design. The primary challenge I faced was getting the chart to render correctly using matplotlib, as the times were based on date objects that required conversion into a numeric format to perform calculations.  

# Enhancement Three: Database and Security

The artifact utilizes databases to store user login credentials and weights. This provides the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of common database management operations and the specific software structures needed to securely serve multiple users from a shared database. In this case I created a WeighIn model with a foreign key to Django’s auth database to associate each weigh in with a specific user. For this enhancement I have implemented a login system and views which reflect the current user, as well as migrating the database from the default SQLite to a [PostgreSQL database](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/WeightTracker/settings.py#L82). This provides a more scalable and feature-rich database environment. While SQLite would likely serve well in this application, migrating the database shows familiarity with both systems and the ability to use Django commands like dumpdata to create database backups from which the application can be restored without data loss or corruption.  
 
The artifact demonstrates a security mindset by developing [robust authentication and authorization components](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/weighin/views.py#L42-L51) for the application, ensuring that users are only presented with the data that specifically pertains to them. Further, by using [Django’s powerful and secure login capabilities](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/tree/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/accounts) as the base for these changes, I have demonstrated an appropriate approach to implementing user authorization, which means relying on trusted libraries for this functionality rather than trying to reimplement it from scratch, which could pose security concerns. I’ve also implemented sensitive information such as database credentials as [environmental variables](https://github.com/wyrxr/wyrxr.github.io/blob/main/WeightTrackerDjangoApp/WeightTracker/settings.py#L80-L90) to ensure that these would not appear in the codebase in plaintext.

In this enhancement I learned how to make a website responsive to a user’s login status and present data based on information associated with that user’s account. I also learned about proper database management procedures and the strengths and weaknesses of different database providers. The principal challenge during this enhancement was getting the site to properly display for users who were not logged in, which required using Django’s LoginRequiredMixin to ensure that a class-based view could only be accessed by a logged-in user. This ensures that the site does not try to render a page based on information that doesn’t exist in the database.  

# Conclusion

The computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been an unforgettable experience. The skills and knowledge I have acquired during my time in this program have equipped me to further my career and education. I have the opportunity now to step into a professional position with full confidence in my strengths and capabilities.
